# Canven JavaScript Game Engine

The canvan game engine is based on JavaScript with HTML5 and Canvas. Many of the patterns used in this game engine come from the many different C/C++ game engines I have written over the years.

The core graphics system isn't abstracted from the engine because canvas is the main technology driving this simple game engine.  As the technology grows and different graphic pipelines come available this architecture may change.

## Requirements

The only thing you need is a text editor and a modern browser to run this code.  There are no extern libraries that are needed to run this engine.  It does work fine with jQuery or other like libraries.

## Documentation

Sorry currently there is not much documentaiton on how to use the engine except for the tid bits of code in the demogame.js project file.  As development progresses this will change.
